description: "A professional easing curve editor panel for Adobe After Effects. Draw, save, and apply custom Bezier easing curves, built for real production workflows."
icon: "wave-sine"
---

After Effects' built-in graph editor is functional but slow. **Wavy 3AM** gives you a dedicated, always-open panel where you can draw easing curves with full Bezier control, save them as presets, and apply them to any property in one click.

No scripting. No awkward graph editor gymnastics. Just draw and apply.
