description: "A professional easing curve editor panel for Adobe After Effects. Draw, save, and apply custom Bezier easing curves, built for real production workflows."
icon: "wave-sine"
tag: "NEW"
---

After Effects' built-in graph editor is functional but slow. **Wavy 3AM** gives you a dedicated, always-open panel where you can draw easing curves with full Bezier control, save them as presets, and apply them to any property in one click.

No scripting. No awkward graph editor gymnastics. Just draw and apply.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Presets aren't saving / panel can't access files">
    Wavy 3AM saves preset files to your Documents folder. After Effects blocks file system access by default — you need to enable it manually.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open After Effects Preferences">
        - **Windows:** Edit → Preferences → Scripting & Expressions
        - **macOS:** After Effects → Preferences → Scripting & Expressions
      </Step>
      <Step title="Enable file access">
        Check **Allow Scripts to Write Files and Access Network**.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Restart After Effects">
        Close and reopen After Effects for the change to take effect.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    <Warning>
      Without this setting enabled, Wavy 3AM cannot read or write preset files. This is the most common cause of presets not appearing or saving.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Extension doesn't appear in Window → Extensions">
    This usually means the extension wasn't installed in the right folder, or After Effects hasn't been restarted since installation.

    - Confirm the `Wavy 3AM` folder is in the correct CEP extensions directory (see Installation)
    - Make sure the folder contains `CSXS/manifest.xml` — if it's nested inside another folder, move it up one level
    - Fully quit and reopen After Effects (not just close the panel)
    - If it still doesn't appear, try the ZXP Installer method instead of manual installation
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Extension loads but shows a blank or white panel">
    This is a CEP rendering issue. Try the following in order:

    1. Close the panel, then reopen it from **Window → Extensions → Wavy 3AM**
    2. Clear the CEP cache:
       - **Windows:** Delete `%AppData%\Adobe\CEP\extensions`
       - **macOS:** Delete `~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions`
    3. Reinstall the extension and restart After Effects
    4. If you're on Windows, make sure your graphics drivers are up to date — CEP panels render via Chromium Embedded Framework and can be affected by GPU driver issues
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Unsigned extension won't load (after manual install)">
    If the extension is installed but After Effects silently ignores it, you may need to enable unsigned extension support.

    **Windows:**

    1. Open Registry Editor (`regedit`)
    2. Navigate to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Adobe\CSXS.9`
    3. Add a new String Value: name `PlayerDebugMode`, value `1`
    4. Restart After Effects

    **macOS:**

    1. Open Terminal
    2. Run: `defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.9 PlayerDebugMode 1`
    3. Restart After Effects

    <Note>
      The key version (`CSXS.9`) matches After Effects CC 2019+. 
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Curve isn't applying to my property">
    - Make sure you have a property **with at least 2 keyframes** selected in the timeline before clicking Apply
    - Wavy 3AM works on the selected property row. Click directly on the property name in the timeline to select it
    - Check that the property type is supported: numeric (1D/2D/3D), spatial, or color properties work. Effect checkboxes, dropdowns, and marker properties are not supported
    - If applying to a shape path, make sure the path topology (number of vertices) hasn't changed between keyframes
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Copy from AE isn't working">
    - Select the **property row** in the timeline (click the property name), not just a keyframe diamond
    - The property must have 2 or more keyframes for the curve to be readable
    - Make sure **Allow Scripts to Write Files and Access Network** is enabled in preferences (see above)
    - Expressions on the property can interfere, temporarily disable any expressions before copying
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Panel is slow or lagging">
    - If you have an **animated GIF** set as the background, this is expected, GIF playback is CPU-intensive inside a CEP panel. Switch to a static image or remove the background to restore performance
    - On very large preset libraries, the panel may take a moment to load. Consider splitting presets into multiple groups to keep each group manageable
    - Reduce **UI Scale** in settings if the panel feels sluggish on lower-end hardware
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
